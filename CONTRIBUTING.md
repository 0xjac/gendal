## **Guidelines for the Code Base**

* Please **do not** manually edit any code in the "models" directory.  It is generated by `gen.sh` script in the root directory. It is possible to change behavior or add new information by editing `gen.sh` but is generally easier to make changes to behavior in the interal/loader or override functions within the "loaders" directory. This is where it maps the content that was generated in the "models" directory.

* If you make changes to the template folder then be sure to run the `tpl.sh` script to generate the code in the tplbin that is included within the final built executable.
