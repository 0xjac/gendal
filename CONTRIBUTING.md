## **Reporting Bugs or Requesting Enhancements**

* Use the Issues section to report any bugs or enhancements.

* If it is a bug involving the code generation please include the SQL script that was used to create the database that was used for generation.

## **Providing Fixes or Enhancements**

* Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Guidelines for the Code Base**

* Please **do not** manually edit any code in the `models` directory.  It is generated by `gen.sh` script in the root directory. It is possible to change behavior or add new information by editing `gen.sh` but is generally easier to make changes to behavior in the internal/loader.go or its override functions within the `loaders` directory. This is where it maps the results of the queries that were generated in the `models` directory.

* If you make changes within the templates folder then be sure to run the `tpl.sh` script to generate the code in the tplbin that is included within the final built executable.
